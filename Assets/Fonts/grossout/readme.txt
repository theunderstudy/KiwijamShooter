Grossout
Copyright (C) 1998 Letters From The Claw

Designed while The Claw recovered from the Flesh Eating Virus, Grossout is an all-caps-and-nuthin-else TrueType font that costs nothing.  Since Your Emperor suffered gruesomely from a virus while creating this, he orders you to treat this font like a disease - give it to somebody whether they want it or not.  Put it on a disk, approach your victim, cough in their face, then hand them the disk, saying "Here's a grossout from The Claw."

This font is freely - in fact, it's mandatory - redistributable, but please include this li'l text file.
