Grossout Shadow - © 1998 Letters From The Claw

A bolder, shadowed version of my grossest font ever.  Possibly the closest I've come to the kind of fonts I want to make.

Distribute promiscuously, but include the readme file, please, or you will get strep throat and suffer horribly as I did while making this font.  Trust me, including the readme file is the smarter course of action.
